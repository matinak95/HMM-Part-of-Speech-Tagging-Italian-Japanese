README for the part-of-speech tagging corpus used in Coding Assignment 4, USC course CSCI-544 (Applied Natural Language Processing), Spring 2020.

The corpus has been adapted from the Italian (ISDT) and Japanese (GSD) sections of the universal dependencies corpus. The source corpora, documentation, and credits can be found at http://universaldependencies.org

Adaptations include:

- The corpus contains only tokens and original parts of speech.
- The format has been changed to the word/TAG format, with each sentence on a separate line. The 'raw' files contain the words only.

Adaptations were made by Ron Artstein, artstein@ict.usc.edu
